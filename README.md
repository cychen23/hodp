Included is the code I used to create the article, as well as the article itself. It delves into the donation habits of Harvard faculty members, 
and what variables may affect their contributions.

rather than personally relevant ones. For example, the election campaign for Senator Warnock received an high amount of donations, unproportional to the amount of 
faculty members originating from Georgia.
